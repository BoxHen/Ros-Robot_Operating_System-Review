workspace: represents the working area that contains the file we need to run ros or ros application, and all workspaces have a setup bash and sh. bash must be executed to enable the workspace.
	we do this with the command source. but a good practice is to write it into the .bashrc instead of doing it manually everytime
	
	roscd will take you to the default workspace

	roscore starts the main node

	when working in ros it is not common practice or convient to work in the default workspace so the common practice is to make your own work space

	we can do this by creating a workspace for catkin(complation framework used by the ros env)
	to create a catkin workspace, we make a new directory in the home folder (mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src)
		src will contain the source files and packages for ros
		wprkspace will be working area and packages will be your own individual projects
		compile work space with catkin_make
Packages
	also your projects, and are defined in the workspace (in src folder)
	creating a new package, use catkin_create_pkg
	to finalize, go back to catkin workspace and use catkin_make
