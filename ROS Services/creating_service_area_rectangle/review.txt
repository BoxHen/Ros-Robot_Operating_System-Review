1. What is the command used to create a ROS package called ros_service_assignment?
Make sure to clarify the path where to create it.
	first we cd into the catkin workspace (catkin_ws), go into src, and use the command 		catkin_create_pkg (will look like this: catkin_create_pkg ros_service_assignment rospy roscpp)

2.What is the name of the folder when to create the service file?
Provide the absolute path to the file (from the root).
	That folder name is "srv". The path to that folder is typically:
	Home/catkin_ws/src/ros_service_assignment/srv

3.What is the content of the service file RectangleAreaService.srv?
	It contains the parameters and the return:
	float32 width
	float32 height
	---
	float32 area

4.What are the changes you need to do in the CMakeLists.txt. Copy/paste the whole CMakeLists.txt.
	1. add message_generation:
		find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  			roscpp
  			rospy
  			message_generation
		)	
	2. add service files:
		add_service_files(
  			FILES
  			RectangleArea.srv
		)

		generate_messages(
   			DEPENDENCIES
   			std_msgs
 		)	

5.What are the changes you need to do the package.xml? Copy/paste the whole package.xml.
	we need to add two dependencies:
		<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
		<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>

6.What is the command to build the new service and generate executable files?
	first, cd into the catkin_ws folder and do "catkin_make"

7.How to make sure that service files are now created?
Note: please use {...} to format the instruction for better readability and make it easier for me to review.
	to check we can use rossrv list. This will list all the services and we can check if our 		service exists.
